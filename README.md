# Summer Analytics 2025 – Week 1 (CAG Task)

This repository contains my submission for Week 1 of the Summer Analytics CAG track.

## 📁 Contents

- `SA2025_W1.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with data exploration, visualization, and analysis tasks.
- `Cars.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis (car attributes like mpg, horsepower, origin, etc.)

## 📊 Summary

In this week's task, I performed the following:

- Loaded and cleaned the dataset.
- Explored key statistics like mean, standard deviation, quartiles.
- Visualized relationships between variables using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- Filtered and grouped data to extract insights.
- Identified cars that appeared across multiple model years and analyzed their mpg variation.

## 📌 Highlights

- Used `groupby`, `agg`, and `filter` to analyze car appearances.
- Plotted `horsepower vs weight` scatter plots using `Seaborn`, colored by origin and sized by mpg.
- Computed average and standard deviation of mpg for recurring cars.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 3
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
